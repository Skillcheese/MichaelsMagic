## Features
This mod adds automaters to the game, which makes mana farming much less of a hastle.

To begin, press k over a gem in a structure to create an automater there, these are free and you can have as many as you want.

By default automaters are in upgrade mode, and will upgrade any gem which can be afforded, with priority governed by your amplifier skill giving higher priority to amplifiers targeting more things, as well as higher priority going to the structures with worse gems. The other mode is Replace mode, which allows you to gem weave to your heart's content on a gem, place it in the top right inventory slot, and the automaters will replace their held gems for that gem, again with priority as defined above.

You can switch between these modes with alt + j.

Also adds expected damage to the bottom of gem tooltips.

## Hotkeys
By default MichaelsMagic's hotkeys are:
```
- In the talisman menu -
k - create or destroy an automater on the structure under the mouse cursor (Trap, Tower, Amplifier, or Lantern) (You will know which structures have automaters based on the red * on top of them)
alt + j - switch between upgrade and replace mode - defined above
j - enable or disable automaters
```

# Planned Ideas
* Full automation of shadow core \ talisman fragment farming
* Integration with gemsmith for gem weaving
